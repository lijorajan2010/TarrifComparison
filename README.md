# TarrifComparison

Task: Tariff Comparison.

Develop a model to build up the following two products and to compare these products based on their annual costs. The comparison should accept the following input parameter: 
Consumption (kWh/year) 
and create a list of these products with the columns 
Tariff name 
Annual costs (€/year) 
The list should be sorted by costs in ascending order. 

Products 

1. Product A 
Name: "basic electricity tariff” 
Calculation model: base costs per month 5 € + consumption costs 22 cent/kWh 
Examples: 
Consumption = 3500 kWh/year => Annual costs = 830 €/year (5€ * 12 months = 60 € base costs + 3500 kWh/year* 22 cent/kWh = 770 € consumption costs) 
Consumption = 4500 kWh/year => Annual costs = 1050 €/year (5€ * 12 months = 60 € base costs + 4500 kWh/year* 22 cent/kWh = 990 € consumption costs) 
Consumption = 6000 kWh/year => Annual costs = 1380 €/year (5€ * 12 months = 60 € base costs + 6000 kWh/year* 22 cent/kWh = 1320 € consumption costs) 

2. Product B 
Name: "Packaged tariff" 
Calculation model: 800 € for up to 4000 kWh/year and above 4000 kWh/year additionally 30 cent/kWh. 
Examples: 
Consumption = 3500 kWh/year => Annual costs = 800 €/ year.
Consumption = 4500 kWh/year => Annual costs = 950 €/year (800€ + 500 kWh * 30 cent/kWh 150 € additional consumption costs) 
Consumption = 6000 kWh/year => Annual costs = 1400 €/year (800€ + 2000 kWh * 30 cent/kWh = 600 € additional consumption costs).
